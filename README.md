# Advent-of-C
My solutions to Advent of Code puzzles, in C specifically.

Credit to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for the puzzles. And credit to the fine folks of [Stack Overflow,](https://stackoverflow.com/) [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org) and the internet in general for teaching me the stuff I needed to know to solve them

Everything past this point is just quick descriptions of what each file does. More information can be found in the files themselves.
