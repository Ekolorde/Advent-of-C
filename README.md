# Advent-of-C
My solutions to Advent of Code puzzles, in C specifically.

Credit to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for the puzzles. And credit to the kind folks of [Stack Overflow,](https://stackoverflow.com/) [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org) and the internet in general for teaching me the stuff I needed to know to solve them

Everything past this point is just quick descriptions of what each file does. More information can be found in the files themselves.

## 2015 Puzzles

[**Day 1: Not Quite Lisp.**](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1) Finds the solution to its respective puzzle using a built in puzzle input, making it pretty useless unless you go in and edit the input variable yourself before compiling.

[**Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math.**](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/2) Does a bunch of fancy math using a separate input file located in the same folder with the same filename but a .txt file extension. Or it would if I could get the damn thing to work.
