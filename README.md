# Advent-of-C
My solutions to Advent of Code puzzles, in C specifically.

All of the programs that require an input file have one included in the "Compiled programs" folder, but should work with any other official puzzle input. (Official in this case meaning obtained from the AoC website)

Credit to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for the puzzles. And credit to the kind folks of [Stack Overflow,](https://stackoverflow.com/) [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org) and the internet in general for teaching me the stuff I needed to know to solve them

All code in this repo is subject to the Unlicense, except for included C libraries I didn't make, (stdio.h, string.h, stdlib.h, that sort of thing) I don't actually know how those are licensed.

Everything past this point is just quick descriptions of what each file does. More information can be found in the files themselves.

## 2015 Puzzles

[**Day 1: Not Quite Lisp.**](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1) Finds the solution to its respective puzzle using a built in puzzle input, making it pretty useless unless you go in and edit the input variable yourself before compiling.

[**Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math.**](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/2) Does a bunch of fancy math using a separate input file located in the same folder with the same filename but a .txt file extension.
